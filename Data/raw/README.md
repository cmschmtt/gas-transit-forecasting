## Real prices

The "real prices" subfolder contains inflation-adjusted prices for diesel and gasoline. These data are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, downloaded [via web](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/realprices/). From the download page:

> "Real Petroleum Prices are computed by dividing the nominal price in a given month by the ratio of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in that month to the CPI in some "base" period. The Real Petroleum Prices spreadsheet and charts are updated every month so that the current month is the base period in the monthly price series. Consequently, all real prices are expressed in "current" dollars and any current month price may be compared directly with any past or projected real prices."
